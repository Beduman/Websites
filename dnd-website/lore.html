        <h1>
            Capital City
        </h1>
        <p>
            Powered by an ancient generator, this is definitely the most advanced city in the region. 
            Built on the remains of a lost civilization, the Capital City is the hub of all new innovation 
            and inventions, but it is also massively overcrowded. There isn’t enough order to keep everyone in 
            check, which has led to organized crime taking sections of the city. Whatever you want or need, 
            good or bad, you can find it here.
        </p>

        <h1>Copernus</h1>
        <p>
            The wood elves and gnomes of Copernus live in the trees and in harmony with nature. 
            Instead of shunning technology, they often hold it sacred. 
            They don't use what they find for just everyday living, but find a use for it nonetheless. 
            Like when becoming of age, they will often grant one of the cybernetic powers to a young adult.
        </p>

        <h1>Everfall</h1>
        <p>
	        A great city that has banned any business that relates to Cybernetics. 
            Most people here dislike the idea of technology mixing with biology, but welcome any new 
            inventions outside of that field. The rule over the region of Everfall has stayed with 
            one family for generations. Currently, Lady Alexandria of Everfall rules. She is often called 
            the heart of the people and the citizens love her.

        </p>

        <h1>Singing Hill</h1>
	    <p>
            A peaceful farmland. The folks here provide food for the Lady of Everfall and her realm. 
            You’ll find plenty of good natured folk here, but people tend to be wary of strangers and adventurers. 
            They are content with what they have, and they want peace over anything new that could change the town.
        </p>

        <h1>Irondeep</h1>
        <p>
	        Irondeep is the home of Lord Farghaus, a stern man who treats those close to him as royalty, 
            and commoners as numbers. Irondeep itself is a very prosperous city, with many keeps, towers, 
            and walls to defend itself, and to provide order. Those in the outer city and the East Gate tend to be poor, 
            just trying to make ends meet, while the people of the inner city, and the West Gate couldn’t ask for more.
        </p>

        <h1>Regnis</h1>
        <p>
	        A good reason why the city of Irondeep can have such a big upper class is because of the workings here. 
            Petty criminals and those in debt are often sent here from irondeep. Working here for a certain amount of 
            time can pay off your debt, but the living conditions are terrible. Those raised here aren’t under the 
            same petty living as those paying off debts or crimes, but it is not the cleanest or safest place to live.
        </p>

        <h1>Hollowsong</h1>
        <p>
            The land of misfits and wild magic, Hollowsong can seem like a gloomy region on the surface. But 
            the magic often coalesces into beautiful lights at night. A long time ago, there were many Dark Elves 
            that forswore slavery and ran here. With the help of Everfall, these dark elves fought a war 
            with their former brethren and won, granting them the freedom they desired.
